          <p>UniYo is a proprietary messaging application for educational institutions.</p>
          <p>These UniYo Terms of Service (the ‚ÄúTerms‚Äù) are a legal contract between you and UniYo, Inc. (‚ÄúUniYo‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù or ‚Äúus‚Äù). These Terms explain how you are permitted to use the UniYo applications and services and any content therein (collectively, the ‚ÄúServices‚Äù).</p>
          <p>Unless otherwise specified, all references to the Services include the services available through the UniYo web or mobile applications (collectively the ‚ÄúApps‚Äù), as well as any software that UniYo provides to you that allows you to access the Services from a mobile device and any other Materials (as defined below).

The member is solely responsible for his/her account and all communications and actions taken with it.</p>
